test1.txt has high hit/miss (pf=3) ratio  because some pages are called multiple times without calling more than 3 other pages after them. While in text2.txt although all pages are called multiple times, but when the pf is small (pf=3) the hit/miss ratio is zero because the calls aren't close to each other so by the time each page gets recalled it would have been already removed causing a miss.
