Deadlock prevention doesn't have any cost in terms of computational power it has to just make one of the conditons(Mutual-Exclusion, Hold-and-Wait, Circular wait) false so that the dealock doesn't occur but this happens at the cost of lowered device utilization. While deadlock avoidance doesn't have lowered device utilization as it works dynamically to allocate resources to processes while checking if it's safe to do so or not, but the issue here is that it can block processed for too long. Finally deadlock recovery lets the system get into a deadlock then trys to detect it then tries to recover by either preemption, killing processes or rolling back, but deadlock recovery isn't used in traditional OSs as it's time and space consuming and is mainly used in real-time OSs
